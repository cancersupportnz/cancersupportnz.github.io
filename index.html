                <h2>Community Care Visit
                Bringing Joy and Warmth to the Elderly — Volunteers Visit Rosedale Village</h2>
                <p>Date: October 3, 2025</p>
                <p>Location: Rosedale Village & Alden Ultimate Care Home</p>
                <p>Participants: 9 volunteers from Cancer Support NZ</p>
                <p>Beneficiaries: Over 100 elderly residents</p>   
                
                <p>To promote the spirit of care and companionship, Cancer support NZ organized a heartwarming visit to Rosedale Village on
                October 3, 2025. Nine dedicated volunteers prepared more than ten types of engaging and interactive cognitive games,
                such as pass-the-ball, balloon tapping, and Rubik’s cube challenges. These games were provided for entertainment and joy
                to the elderly residents but also supported them to exercise their responsiveness and coordination skills.</p>
            
                <p>For those unable to join the games due to mobility challenges, volunteers offered gentle companionship and heartfelt
                conversations, ensuring that every resident felt seen, cared for, and valued. The two-hour event was filled with smiles,
                laughter, and genuine warmth.</p>
                
                <p>At the end of the visit, the care home manager expressed deep gratitude to our volunteers and warmly invited our team to
                return in the near future, extending our companionship to elderly residents in expand to the hospital wards.</p>
                
                <p>This experience left a profound impression on all volunteers. They gained a deeper understanding of the elderly’s need
                for emotional connection and companionship, while also discovering the true joy that comes from serving others. The
                happiness sparked by acts of kindness and the “dopamine of giving.”</p>
                
                <p>Cancer Support NZ will continue to carry forward this spirit of service, joining hands with the wider community to bring
                care, dignity, and joy to the elderly, one heartfelt visit at a time.</p>

                <h2>Dance Therapy</h2>
                <p>In 2025, Cancer support NZ gathered six volunteers for an online- Dance Therapy Program. Among the participants, some
                were facing sleep difficulties or emotional distress, while others were recovering from cancer treatment.</p>
                <p>Under the guidance of a volunteer ballroom dancer, volunteers practiced gentle waltz movements for half an hour before
                bedtime. After several online sessions, participants reported better sleep, faster relaxation, and a brighter mood.</p>
                <p>This activity demonstrated the positive impact of dance on both physical and emotional recovery, strengthening our
                belief in ‘ dance therapy’ as a gentle and effective non-medical approach.</p>
                <p>Through this project, we learned empathy and patience, and we witnessed how small acts can create deep healing. Moving
                forward, we will continue exploring the connection between psychology and technology using dance + smart innovation to
                bring comfort, connection, and warmth to more lives.</p>

                <p>Cancer Support NZ recently held a community fundraiser at the Takapuna Market, selling popcorn and drinks to raise funds
                and awareness for our cause. We were grateful to have the support of some amazing volunteers who generously gave their
                time to help run the stall and engage with the public. It was a fantastic opportunity to connect with locals, share our
                mission, and raise vital support for those affected by cancer across New Zealand. Thank you to everyone who stopped by —
                your generosity helps us continue making a difference.</p>
